# What's new in Folio, PulseWise and MarkRoom

Newest first, each entry dated. A version number can stay the same from one entry to the next, so an update goes by the
date: the entries after the date a tool's copy was installed on a computer are new there.

## 2026-11-07, later · MarkRoom 1.0.0 (number unchanged)

- **MarkRoom:** dragging the playhead on a video's timeline shows the frames as it goes (one seek at a time, always to
  the newest spot), and so do held arrow keys and the −1f / +1f buttons. Clicking, double-clicking or dragging on the
  timeline, or dragging a tab, never selects text. New boards keep a keyframe every half second in their review videos
  (a render's own copy is re-encoded when its keyframes are further apart than a second), so the preview keeps up.

## 2026-11-07 · Folio 1.0.0, PulseWise 1.0.0, MarkRoom 1.0.0 (numbers unchanged)

- **MarkRoom:** a link Claude sends ends in `#open-<file id>` and opens that file directly, even when a newer round is
  waiting (that round still opens on the next plain visit); a link to a closed tab lands on the nearest open one.
  Whenever Claude changes something in a board, its message links straight to each file that changed.
- **PulseWise:** a background job started for a point of the task list is filed under that point. On Windows, when a
  long job or the whole list finishes while the Claude app is behind other windows, its taskbar button flashes until
  you come back. Its tests pass on Windows as well as the Mac.
- **Folio:** the context bar's hover texts name how much of each kind of work sits below and above the fold-back line
  (the two add up to the whole), and both parts of the room lead with the room left before the fold. Its tests pass on
  Windows as well as the Mac.
